# React/Redux Blog With TDD

Tutorial from Udemy's 'Advanced React and Redux' by Stephen Grider. Demonstrates how to create tests using Mocha and Chai for React components, action creators and reducers.

* *mocha*: a testing framework -- it gives you a nice syntax for organizing your tests and has several other features like asynchronous test support and easy-to-read output. 
* *chai*: an assertion library.
* *chai-jquery*: Library for assertions, to be used along with Mocha. Chai-only assertions work fine for BE assertions, but using jQuery selector allows us to make assertions on the React components HTML.
* *react-addons-test-utils*: Provides utility function for creating test helpers
