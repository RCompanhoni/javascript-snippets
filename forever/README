Forever example (from https://github.com/EvanHahn/Express.js-in-Action-code/tree/master/Chapter_10/forever-example)

Forever is a module that keeps your apps running forever -- if your app crashes, Forever will try to restart it. Change the script section in the package.json 
to 

    "scripts": {
        "start": "forever app.js"
    },
