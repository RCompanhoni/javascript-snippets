# Google Custom Search Chrome Extension

An adaptation from the official Chrome Extension tutorial (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) -- the old Google Images API is not supported anymore so
this example is an adaptation using the new Google Custom Search API. When the extension icon is clicked a query is made to the GCS API with the current URL and the results 
are displayed in an unordered list, in the extension HTML popup.
