# Webpack code splitting

From Stephen Grider's Webpack 2: The Complete Developer's Guider. This example shows how to use **System.import** along with **module.default()** to make webpack split the bundle and optimize loading performance.

Open *index.html* and take a look at the 'network' tab -- only when the button is clicked a 0.bundle.js file will be retrieved.
