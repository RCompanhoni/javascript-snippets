# Simplest code splitting

From Stephen Grider's Webpack 2: The Complete Developer's Guider. This example shows how using **System.import** along with **module.default()** makes webpack to split the bundle and optimize loading performance.

Open *index.html* and take a look at the 'network' tab -- only when the button is clicked a 0.bundle.js file will be retrieved.
