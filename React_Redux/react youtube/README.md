# REACT YOUTUBE

From Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux. This is a simple example to demonstrate basic concepts of React.

### PACKAGES USED

* **react**: An npm package to get you immediate access to React, without also requiring the JSX transformer. This is especially useful for cases where you want to browserify your module using React
* **react-dom**: serves as the entry point of the DOM-related rendering paths. It is intended to be paired with the isomorphic React
* **youtube-api-search**: Stephen Grider's youtube API client
